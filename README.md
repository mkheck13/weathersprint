## FeedBack/Peer Review:

**Reviewer**: Charles Orr

**Comments**: I reccomend using "cursor: pointer;" to make your buttons more visible, and possibly on load or on click of the search bar call your fiction to append the local storage, very good job i like the way your site looks and how calm the colors are
